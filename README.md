# What the software does:
This program asks the user for their name, and based on a randomly generated number, the code will grab the respective week prediction and tell the user that they will have that kind of week!

# How to install and use the software:
On the main page of our repository, right above the file list, you will see a green "Code" button. Click on it, and a drop down menu will appear. Select "Download ZIP", and your browser will begin downloading the project to your computer. Once the download is complete, locate the .zip file using your file manager, and open it. Once the zip file is unpackaged, you've fully installed the project!

# Usage Documentation:
name1 - The user's name. When prompted, type your name into the command line and hit enter.

# How to contribute:
A GitHub Fork of a repository allows you to have your own copy of the repository to edit without impacting the original repository. To do that, open up our repository and go to the top right corner to find the button "Fork" to have your own copy of the repository. You can also submit pull requests to the owner to change the parent repository. Staying on the main repository page, you can find the category called "Pull Request" and then click the green button to create a new pull request. You can change whatever you want to edit and then submit the request!

# License
We chose the Do What You Want Public License because it would allow other people to add more to/change the code to make the program do whatever they want it to do. Since it's a very basic code that's not very complex, the person can basically use the program as a template or starting point for their project.

# Code of Conduct
We chose the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct ( https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md ) because it includes:

1. The rules that all participants must abide by: the rules primarily focus on making the project a safe environment for everyone. For example, derogatory comments are not permitted. Participants of the project are not allowed to share private information of others.
2. Standards that the community follows: such as being empathetic towards others and demonstrating kindness.
3. Consequences that people who donâ€™t abide by the rules must face, such as being temporarily or permanently banned.
